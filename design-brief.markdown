# Portfolio Design Brief

## Summary A brief summary of the business / site goals.
*What problems are you trying to solve? What is the purpose of the app? (2-3 sentences)*
To create a website showcasing examples of my past projects and growth as a developer. To direct user users to several other profiles at other sites.

## The key users.
*Describe behaviors, expectation, knowledge, or other characteristics. (One sentence each)*
Hiring Managers and Recruiters. I expect them to want a quick overview of myself, my skillset, and my work. I expect them to have a limited or passing knowledge of the tech stack used in the projects.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
*These should be short narratives of the above users with your app / site. (One sentence each)*
A Hiring Manager has clicked a link on my resume and arrived at my portfolio site, they skim through my bio, get a feel for the design of my site, and examine one or two projects that stand out.

A Recruiter has found my site from linkedIn, they look through the Featured Projects, search for links to other profiles

## Design style guidelines to follow.
*These are a list of qualities or characteristics (usually adjectives) you'd like the design to follow. The more specific you are with these the easier it will be for you to create a compelling design (e.g. don't use "Clean"). (2-3 words)*
- Typography focus
- Minimal aesthetic
- Page / card driven UI
